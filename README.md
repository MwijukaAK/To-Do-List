# To-Do-List
This is a basic design of a to do list i thought would look appealing. it consists of simply html and css. 
A user can add new tasks and delete or cross out a task.
I think this design can be improved adding an alarm for the user to be notified in case the task has not been completed and prioritise whether the task is of high priority or low priority
